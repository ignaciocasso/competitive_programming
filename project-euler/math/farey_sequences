A farey sequence is the sorted list of all proper reduced fraction with
denominator lower than N and between 0 and 1.
If a/b and c/d are next to each other in a Farey sequence, then ad-bc=1 and
the fraction between both with lower denominator is (a+c)/(b+d).
It also works the other way, if N is max(b,d)
